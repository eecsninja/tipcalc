Required:

 Upon selecting tip amount, formatted tip value is displayed

Optional:
 User changes the total amount and updated tip is reflected automatically
 User can select how many ways to split the tip
 User can select custom tip percentage if desired
 User can edit preset tip percentages and have them persist across launches

Note: No currency symbols are shown in the app. This is intentional, as tip
calculation is independent of the currency being used.
